# Notes for our presentation

Because we simulated in modelsim, our clock could be very tiny. We tried to optimize around this and made sure we used a realistic clock for the FPGA

Make note of how many processing elements we'll have
> Say that we'll max out the board (up to an optimal ammount)  

Make sure we have a clear definitino of a processing element
> Have a figure in the report and in the final presentation  
> Talk about resources for the processing elements  

Explain why we didn't include the waveform  
> Do some excessive handwaving
